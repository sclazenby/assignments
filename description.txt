I modified the program to look for spending on taxi/parking/tolls that exceeded $100. Interestingly, the the mean amount spent for this purpose (in this subset of data) was $226.02 and the largest value was $2076.26. The most common recipient was Citibank Gov Card Services (238x). The most common program was official expenses of members (491x). There were 547 lines of data that fit this criteria.
